					<h3> VISION STATEMENT </h3>
                    <p>The library will be an integral component of a nationally recognized University. The library and its resources will be the primary intellectual space, both physically and virtually, for the University community. We accomplish this by:<br>
                    <ul>
                       <li> Creating collaborative learning environments that will adapt to the changing needs of the University.</li><br>
                        
                        <li>Integrating librarians, programs, and services into the academic curriculum.</li><br>
                        <li>Developing and providing access to rich and diverse resources regardless of format, location, or mode of access.</li><br>
                        <li>Utilizing relevant current and emerging technologies effectively.</li><br>
                        <li>Acting in partnership with faculty for the development and enhancement of academic courses and programs.</li>
				    </ul>
