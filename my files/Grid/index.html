    <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, a member of the South African Musk family, and briefly attended the University of
        Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two
        years later, he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the
        University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in
        1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded
        online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same
        year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In October 2002,
        eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk
        founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company</p>
