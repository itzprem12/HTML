            military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation
            policy. He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and
            regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes and eliminated the individual
            health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and
            Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.
